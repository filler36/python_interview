"""
This is an example of "Parametric Polymorphism", sometimes referred to as "Generics" in other languages.

Parametric polymorphism allows a function or a data type to be written generically, so that it can handle values identically without depending on their type.

In your example, you're using Python's typing.TypeVar to define a type variable T.
Then, youâ€™re using T as an annotation for the argument to the print_item function, which means print_item can accept any type of value,
and within the function, the value can be handled irrespective of its type.

When print_item is called with an integer or a string, it works with both types because it's been defined to be polymorphic and can take any type.
It applies the same operation (print) regardless of the actual type of the data.
